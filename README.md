This is a full stack app that uses Node.js to create a backend for a dashboard used to schedule rocket launches for NASA space missions.

It is from ZeroToMastery's Node.js Developer course.

## To run this application

After cloning this project, type ``npm run install` into your terminal. This will install
packages on both the backend and the frontend.

Then `npm run watch` will get both the server and client running.

Check the package.json for others scripts.

You'll need to connect to mongodb and use your own connection string.
